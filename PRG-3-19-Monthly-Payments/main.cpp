//  The monthly payment on a loan may be calculated by the following formula:
//  Payment = Rate * (1 + Rate)^n * L
//            -------------------
//             ((1 + Rate)^n - 1)
//  Rate is the monthly interest rate, which is the annual interest rate divided by 12.
//  (12 percent annual interest would be 1 percent monthly interest.) N is the number of
//  payments, and L is the amount of the loan. Write a program that asks for these values
//  then displays a report similar to:
//  Loan Amount:                $10000.00
//  Monthly Interest Rate:      1%
//  Number of Payments:         36
//  Monthly Payment:            $332.14
//  Amount Paid Back:           $11957.15
//  Interest Paid:              $1957.15
